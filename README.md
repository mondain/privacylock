# privacylock
Lock screen or key guard where your data is safe

If you've found this, welcome to the end of a rabbit-hole; I am releasing this code to the public (since someone asked), but it is quite old at this point ~10 years and I am not "maintaining" nor "updating" it. As its quite old, do not expect it to build since the Android ecosystem has moved on in addition to the JDK and tools. 

## Old notes

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=android-quickstart -DarchetypeGroupId=de.akquinet.android.archetypes   -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0  -DgroupId=org.gregoire -DartifactId=privacylock
